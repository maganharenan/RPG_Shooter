// Story ideas

* Main character wakes up in an unknown place;
    * My first idea to this place: Actually the place is inside of the soul of the main character. At the first time is only rain and darkness
    but when you do some stuff the place becomes better;
* Then he arrives at a destroyed town; When lives just one man but his face is hidden (actually he is the main character too);
    * The mysterious man can do some upgrades to the down, like build a blacksmith place and some other stuff;
    * The first upgrade is the church an it is for free (you can get this upgrade accepting to help another mysterious person (again, he is the main character too);
    * Everytime you do some good action like help someone or defeat a boss (sin) the town become happier (at the beginning it is just rain and darkness);
    * (I think that will be cool to put some kids sing "Carol of the bells" at the town in the end of the game when you are about to fight the last boss;
    * I think that I can make some bosses like (the seven deadly sins, the world, the devil and the flesh (the three enemies of our soul);
        * The flesh could be an evil version of the main Character;
* Meaning
    * The main idea of the game is that all people can be better thorough faith;
    * Actually, when the main character defeats some Sin Boss, he defeated a Sin that he usually committed;
    * When the character defeats the sins, the flesh, the world, etc, he becomes stronger;
* NPCs
    * In general, almost of all NPCs are a version of the main character himself, because the game passes inside his mind;
    * But, eventually he can find another people that are part of his memories actually, and this NPCs gets the jobs that our hero can't do;
        * Priest - our hero is a sinner, so he can't be the priest. I would like to do a character inspired in the Father Paulo Ricardo;
        * Blacksmith - He can't be this either, because another person needs to give him the right weapons to defeat the evil inside him, maybe Italo could be this role;
        * Muse - Some girl that he likes, just to give him some reason to follow (she could be a hostage);
        * The Girl of the roses - I don't need to say what it means, but I will. This character represents Saint Thereze of Lisieux;
    * This game is about Sins and Faith, so makes sense to put some Angelic Creatures;
* Enemies
    * Enemies represents all the sins, difficulties and vices from our hero;
* The Hero
    * At the first time I thought that "Hyuk" could be a good name, but this character is inspired on me, so he could be called "Nero";
    * Clothes:
        * I don't know too much about his cloths. I thought that he could dress like a priest and maybe he will;
    * Weapons:
        * I still don't know;
    * About:
        * He doesn't sleep or eat, because he isn't flesh and body in this world, but he think he is, so I need to handle this like he doesn't have this needs anymore;
* World
    * The world is dark and bizarre, but when the hero defeats the boss that rules that map, that place changes into something better;
        * And then the enemies are not the deadly sins, but simple venial sins;
* Trophies
    * Materialist - Open and close any shop without buying anything 5 times;
    * Hedonistic - Spend a lot of money (I don't know, maybe 1.000.000);
    * Universalist - Build all town upgrades;
    * Nihilist - Destroy something (that I still don't know what) 5 times;
* Story
    * I didn't thought too much about it but...
    Could be a story about a guy that is in coma, between life and death, and he needs to take care of his business about his soul,
    because if he don't, he could go straight to hell;
        * At the end of the game, the ideal thing was: He wakes up in the real world and becomes a better person, but to do it I Think that i need to put some flashbacks;
    * Maybe it is a good idea to consult the divine comedy to make a consistent world, but I need to remember that the character isn't in hell, he is trapped
    in his own mind;
* Items
    * Rosary?
    * Cross?
